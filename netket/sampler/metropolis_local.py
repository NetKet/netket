    Sampler acting on one local degree of freedom.

    This sampler acts locally only on one local degree of freedom :math:`s_i`,
    and proposes a new state: :math:`s_1 \dots s^\prime_i \dots s_N`,
    where :math:`s^\prime_i \\neq s_i`.

    The transition probability associated to this
    sampler can be decomposed into two steps:

    1. One of the site indices :math:`i = 1\dots N` is chosen
    with uniform probability.
    2. Among all the possible (:math:`m`) values that :math:`s_i` can take,
    one of them is chosen with uniform probability.

    For example, in the case of spin :math:`1/2` particles, :math:`m=2`
    and the possible local values are :math:`s_i = -1,+1`.
    In this case then :class:`MetropolisLocal` is equivalent to flipping a random spin.

    In the case of bosons, with occupation numbers
    :math:`s_i = 0, 1, \dots n_{\mathrm{max}}`, :class:`MetropolisLocal`
    would pick a random local occupation number uniformly between :math:`0`
    and :math:`n_{\mathrm{max}}`.
